# StackBlitz â€” the missing REPL for SvelteKit

Welcome back April Svelte meetup

<!--
In this talk I would like to show you a new way to run a SvelteKit app in a browser
- to quickly share an example or
- to tinker with SvelteKit.

The team at StackBlitz has implemented a technology called WebContainers that makes this possible, but more on this later.

But let me first introduce myself.

# What is the Svelte REPL?

</div>

<!--
- REPL = Read-eval-print loop.
- Svelte REPL uses the [Svelte template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
- Runs client-side (the Svelte template is a web app). 
- Supports [https://unpkg.com/](https://unpkg.com/).

<!--
- When you make Svelte-specific searches, REPL examples are often among the first results.
- Think of the Svelte REPL as a communication tool for the Svelte community.
- It would be handy if we had something similar to share SvelteKit examples.

# StackBlitz WebContainers

- This was launched in November 2021.
- WebContainers run Node.js client-side in a browser.
- **SvelteKit runs client-side in a browser ðŸ¤¯.**

Running Node.js client-side in a browser is not just like running bundled JavaScript in a browser.

<!--
Show two things:

1. StackBlitz dashboard: https://stackblitz.com/.
2. Route matching example: https://stackblitz.com/github/maiertech/sveltekit-example-route-matching?file=src/routes/index.svelte.

Point out:

- The URL pattern with which you can launch (compatible) projects from a GitHub repository. 
- Read-only mode and forking a StackBlitz project.

# What are WebContainers?

- WebAssembly is a compilation target for languages such as C++ and Rust that makes it possible to run code in a browser at near native speed (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

- StackBlitz managed to run Node.js natively in (Chromium-based) browsers using Web Assembly.

- WebContainers promise:
  - Faster than local dev environment.
  - Node.js debugging in-browser.
  - Execution inside the browser's security sandbox.

- WebContainers blur the line between web apps and native apps.

<!--
Blurring the line between web apps and native apps = tectonic shift:
- Many more types of applications can run in browsers.
- Local dev environments can be moved to browsers.

Shortcomings:
- Not yet ready to replace a local dev environment, especially GitHub support is lacking.
- Chromium-based browsers work fine, support for other browsers is in the works.
- Embedding StackBlitz projects in websites is a little challenging.
